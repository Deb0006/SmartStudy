    question:
      "What are the benefits of using spread syntax and how is it different from rest syntax?",
    answer:
      "Spread syntax allows you to easily expand an array or an object into its individual elements. Rest syntax allows you to easily gather a variable number of arguments into an array.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can you share code between files?",
    answer:
      "You can share code between files by using modules. Modules are JavaScript files that are loaded by a module loader such as RequireJS.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why you might want to create static class members?",
    answer:
      "There are several reasons why you might want to create static class members: to create utility functions that can be used without instantiating an object, to create constants that can be used without instantiating an object, or to create singleton objects.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you name two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers?",
    answer:
      "The two programming paradigms important for JavaScript app developers are object-oriented programming and functional programming.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is functional programming?",
    answer:
      "Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, and that they can be returned from other functions.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?",
    answer:
      "Classical inheritance is a form of inheritance where classes inherit from other classes. Prototypal inheritance is a form of inheritance where objects inherit from other objects.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming?",
    answer:
      "Functional programming has the advantage of being more concise and easier to reason about. However, it can be more difficult to understand for beginners. Object-oriented programming has the advantage of being more familiar to developers coming from other languages. However, it can be more difficult to refactor and can lead to code that is more difficult to reason about.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What are two-way data binding and one-way data flow, and how are they different?",
    answer:
      "Two-way data binding is a form of data binding where changes to the data in one place are automatically reflected in the other place. One-way data flow is a form of data binding where changes to the data in one place are not automatically reflected in the other place.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is asynchronous programming, and why is it important in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Asynchronous programming is a form of programming where the execution of a program is not linear. This means that code can be executed in parallel, and that code can be executed after other code has finished executing. Asynchronous programming is important in JavaScript because it allows for more responsive user interfaces.",
