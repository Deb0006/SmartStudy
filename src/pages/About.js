      <p>
        Welcome to my study website! This platform is designed to help you learn
        effectively and efficiently by using flashcards and a unique spaced
        repetition system.
        {/* With this flashcard system, you can create decks of
        cards with questions and answers on various topics and use them to test
        your knowledge (upcoming feature) */}
      </p>
      <p>
        As you go through the cards, the algorithm will track which ones you
        know and which ones you need more practice on. The questions that you
        know are skipped, while the ones that you are still struggling with are
        repeated until you feel confident in your knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform also includes a variety of customization options, such as
        the ability to save your favorite questions, and review progress at the
        end. With these features, you can tailor your learning experience to fit
        your personal needs and goals.
